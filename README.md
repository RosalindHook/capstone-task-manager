# capstone-task-manager
Task management python project

Two Python coding projects produced as part of my Hyperiondev bootcamp.

1 - The first one makes use of external files (reading and writing data to these)
2 - The second makes use of lists, dictionaries, functions and string handling

Both involve a password check, login details, a menu of options and options to generate reports for the user registered as 'admin'.

My next step for these two capstone projects are to develop the second one further using OOP which I learned later in the bootcamp, and also to build the front end using a Tkinter GUI.
